    </p>
    <h4>ingredients</h4>
    <ul> 
        <li>1/2 lb salmon, seasoned to preference</li>
        <li>1/2 lb imitation crab, shredded & cut into smaller pieces</li>
        <li>3 oz cream cheese</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup Japanese mayo</li>
        <li>1 TBSP sriracha</li>
        <li>2-3 cups cooked rice</li>
        <li>2 TBSP rice vinegar</li>
        <li>Furikake / shredded seaweed</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol class="directions">
        <li>Season salmon to preference. I seasoned mine with garlic powder, salt & black pepper. And then airfry at 400 for 9 mins. if your salmon is thicker, you may have to cook more</li>
        <li>Then shred salmon and add it into your shredded imitation crab.</li>
        <li>Then add the reset of your ingredients: cream cheese, Japanese Mayo & sriracha. Combine well and set aside</li>
        <li>Combine 2-3 cups of cooked rice with 2 TSBP ricevinegar. Mix well. Then pour rice into an oven safe dish and flatten it/creat an flat - equal surface</li>
        <li>Top the rice off with shredded seaweed or furikake. I used 3 seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>Then top your rice + seaweed off with your salmon mixture and spread it evenly</li>
        <li>Bake at 380 for 10 mins (broil for 2-3 mins optional)</li>
        <li>I served my sushi bake wrapped in seaweed. I also like to add cucumbers and/ or avacados into the wrap but I didn't have any</li>
    </ol>
